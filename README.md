AIEC is the decentralized data sharing network protocol based on the blockchain technology. It is also a consensus-based one-stop platform to implement the registration, distribution and transformation of the data among different participants within the broad-based AI ecosystem.

 Our Vision

- To build and become the largest global data sharing network to evolve AI ecosystem via smart data contracts on a blockchain infrastructure.  
- To help people capitalize the data assets with the clear ownership and better control in data privacy through a transparent and democratic mechanism.

Our Goals

- To build the world's most efficient data sharing network “DataMarket” with our proprietary pricing mechanism of the data asset  
- To build the AI model sharing network “ModelMarket” to facilitate the effective management of the AI development cycle  
- To implement the hardware sharing network to streamline the AI product registration and communication
